How recat workd 

	React will create virtual dom, light weight in memory component tree

		When react component change, react will update the particular node in virtual dom, then it will compare current version of virtual dom and previouse version of virtual dom

	React dom: will render component tree

		ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
			<React.StrictMode>
				<App />
			</Rect.StrictMode>,
		)

		In mobile app component tree render will differently, we need to use react native library

React is a java script library for building user interfaces.
